    "detail": "Kobe Bryant’s career is filled with symbolism. On November 3, 1996, the 18‑year‑old rookie scored his first NBA point on a free throw versus the Timberwolves. Two decades later, on April 13, 2016, he sealed his 60‑point finale with two free throws against the Jazz. From first point to last, free throws bookended his journey—speaking to his steadiness and mental toughness. Kobe shot 83.7% from the line and made 8,378 free throws, fourth‑most in NBA history."

It plays off his elite court vision and precision, but it’s more legend than fact. The tale persists because it neatly maps his on‑court traits to an aviator’s skill set—anticipation, discipline, and timing."

During a fishing trip, Duncan supposedly faked falling overboard to test Pop’s reaction—then popped up laughing. Whether apocryphal or real, the story captures Duncan’s dry humor and the trust that anchored one of the NBA’s greatest coach‑star partnerships."
